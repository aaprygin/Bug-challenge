# Bug Report: Dependents Field Prevents Submission with Invalid or Empty Values

---

## Bug ID:
UI-008

---

## Title:
Dependents Field Prevents Submission with Invalid, Empty, or Excessive Values

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
The "Dependents" field in the "Add Employee" and "Update Employee" forms prevents submission when certain invalid conditions are met:
- If the field is left empty, the "Add" or "Update" button becomes unclickable.
- If the field contains invalid characters (e.g., letters, symbols), the button becomes unclickable.
- If the field contains a number exceeding the maximum allowed value (e.g., greater than 32), the button does not work.  

No warning or validation messages are displayed to inform the user of the issue, resulting in a poor user experience.

---

## Steps to Reproduce:
### Issue 1: Empty Field
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
3. Leave the "Dependents" field empty.
4. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
5. Attempt to click the "Add" button.
6. Observe that the "Add" button is unclickable.

### Issue 2: Invalid Characters
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter invalid characters (e.g., `abc`, `!@#`, or `2a`) in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Attempt to click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that the "Add" button is unclickable.

### Issue 3: Value Exceeds Maximum Limit
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter a number greater than 32 (e.g., `33` or `32767`) in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Attempt to click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that the "Add" button does not work.

## Expected Result:
1. The "Dependents" field should validate input and:
   - Display a clear warning for empty fields:  
     **"The Dependents field cannot be empty."**
   - Reject invalid characters with a warning:  
     **"Only numeric values between 0 and 32 are allowed."**
   - Reject numbers exceeding the maximum limit with a warning:  
     **"The number of dependents must not exceed 32."**
2. The "Add" or "Update" button should remain functional when valid input is provided.

---

## Actual Result:
1. The "Add" or "Update" button becomes unclickable when:
   - The "Dependents" field is empty.
   - The field contains invalid characters (letters, symbols).
   - The field contains a number exceeding the maximum allowed value (greater than 32).
2. No warning or validation message is displayed to inform the user of the issue.
