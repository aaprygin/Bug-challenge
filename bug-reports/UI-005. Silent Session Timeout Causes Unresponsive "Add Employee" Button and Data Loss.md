## Title:
Silent Session Timeout Causes Unresponsive "Add Employee" Button and Data Loss

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
If the user stays idle on the dashboard page for an extended period, the session times out silently without any warning. After this, attempting to add a new employee results in the "Add" button becoming unresponsive, and refreshing the page causes all employee data in the table to disappear. The "Log Out" button also vanishes, requiring the user to manually navigate to the login URL to log in again. This issue creates usability problems and leads to potential data loss.

---

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Stay idle on the dashboard page for an extended period (e.g., 5+ minutes).
3. Attempt to add a new employee by clicking the "Add Employee" button and filling out the form.
4. Click the "Add" button and observe that it does not work.
5. Click the "Cancel" button to exit the form.
6. Refresh the page and note that:
   - All employee data disappears from the table.
   - The "Log Out" button disappears.
7. Attempt to interact with the page further, and note that it requires navigating to the login URL and logging in again.

---

## Expected Result:
1. The application should display a warning message or countdown before the session times out.
2. If the session has expired, the user should be redirected to the login page immediately.
3. The "Add Employee" functionality should remain responsive if the session is still valid.
4. Employee data should not disappear from the table after refreshing the page.

---

## Actual Result:
1. The session times out silently without any warning.
2. The "Add" button in the "Add Employee" form becomes unresponsive after timeout.
3. Clicking "Cancel" does not resolve the issue; refreshing the page causes:
   - Loss of all employee data from the table.
   - Disappearance of the "Log Out" button.
4. The user must manually navigate to the login URL to log in again.
