# Bug Report: Dependents Field Does Not Handle Invalid Inputs Properly

---

## Bug ID:
UI-008

---

## Title:
Dependents Field Does Not Handle Invalid Numbers or Characters Properly

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
The "Dependents" field in the "Add Employee" form correctly accepts numbers from 0 to 32 inclusively. However, entering values greater than 32 or invalid characters (such as letters or symbols) causes the "Add" or "Update" buttons to become unresponsive. No warning or validation message is displayed, leaving the user unable to proceed or understand the issue.

---

## Steps to Reproduce:
### Issue 1: Invalid Numbers
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
3. In the "Dependents" field, enter a number greater than 32 (e.g., `33` or `100`).
4. Fill in all other required fields correctly.
5. Click the "Add" button.
6. Observe that:
   - The button does not perform any action.
   - No warning or validation message is displayed.

### Issue 2: Invalid Characters
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
3. In the "Dependents" field, enter invalid characters (e.g., `abc`, `!@#`, or `2a`).
4. Fill in all other required fields correctly.
5. Click the "Add" button.
6. Observe that:
   - The button does not perform any action.
   - No warning or validation message is displayed.

---

## Expected Result:
1. The "Dependents" field should validate input and:
   - Reject numbers greater than 32 with a clear warning message:  
     **"The number of dependents must be between 0 and 32."**
   - Reject non-numeric input with a clear warning message:  
     **"Only numeric values are allowed in the dependents field."**
2. The "Add" or "Update" button should remain functional after valid input.

---

## Actual Result:
1. The "Dependents" field allows numbers greater than 32 and invalid characters to be entered.
2. Clicking the "Add" or "Update" button does not trigger any action or display a warning message.
