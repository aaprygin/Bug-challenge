## Bug ID:
UI-010

## Title:
Clicking on "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" Redirects to Empty Table with Non-Functional Add Button in Form

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
On the login page, clicking on the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" title unexpectedly redirects the user to the main dashboard. However, the table is empty, no logout button is displayed, and while the "Add Employee" button opens the form, the "Add" button within the form does not work after entering data. This behavior creates a confusing user experience and prevents the addition of new employees.

2. Click on the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" title at the top of the page.

   - The table is empty with no employee data.
   - The "Log Out" button is missing.
4. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
5. Fill in all fields in the "Add Employee" form with valid data.
6. Click the "Add" button in the form.
7. Observe that:
   - The "Add" button does not work.
   - No employee is added to the table.

1. Clicking the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" title should not redirect the user without proper authentication.

## Actual Result:
1. Clicking the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" title redirects the user to the dashboard without proper authentication.
