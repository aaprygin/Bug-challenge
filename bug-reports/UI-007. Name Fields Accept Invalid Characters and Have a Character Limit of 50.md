# Bug Report: Name Fields Accept Invalid Characters and Have a Character Limit of 50

---

## Bug ID:
UI-007

---

## Title:
Name Fields Accept Invalid Characters and Have a Character Limit of 50

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
The "First Name" and "Last Name" fields in the "Add Employee" form allow the entry of invalid characters such as symbols (`@`, `#`), numbers (`123`), and emojis (`ðŸ˜©`). Additionally, these fields have a maximum limit of 50 characters, which is not communicated to the user. When entering more than 50 characters, the "Add" or "Update" buttons become unclickable, and no warning or validation message is displayed to inform the user of the issue. This behavior is confusing and prevents the user from completing their action.

---

## Steps to Reproduce:
### Issue 1: Invalid Characters
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
3. In the "First Name" field, enter invalid characters such as `214812048019284 214124124 ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©`.
4. In the "Last Name" field, enter invalid characters such as `1234wrwr)(;.,:%"!_=`.
5. Click the "Add" button.
6. Observe that the form accepts and saves the invalid input without validation.

### Issue 2: Character Limit
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
3. In the "First Name" or "Last Name" field, enter more than 50 characters (e.g., `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing`).
4. Click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that:
   - The input is truncated to 50 characters.
   - No warning or error message is displayed to inform the user of the character limit.

---

## Expected Result:
1. The "First Name" and "Last Name" fields should:
   - Allow only alphabetic characters, hyphens (`-`), and apostrophes (`'`).
   - Reject non-numeric input with a clear warning message:  
     **"Names can only contain alphabetic characters, hyphens, and apostrophes."**
2. The character limit (50) should be communicated to the user with a warning or error message:  
   **"Names cannot exceed 50 characters."**

---

## Actual Result:
1. The "First Name" and "Last Name" fields accept invalid characters such as numbers, symbols, and emojis.
2. Input exceeding 50 characters disables the "Add" or "Update" buttons without any warning or error message.
