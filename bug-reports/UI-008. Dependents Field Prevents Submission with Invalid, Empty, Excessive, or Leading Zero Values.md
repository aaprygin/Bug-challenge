# Bug Report: Dependents Field Prevents Submission with Invalid, Empty, Excessive, or Leading Zero Values and Processes Partial Inputs Incorrectly

## Bug ID:
UI-008

## Title:
Dependents Field Processes Partial Inputs Incorrectly and Prevents Submission with Invalid, Empty, Excessive, or Leading Zero Values

---

## Description:
The "Dependents" field in the "Add Employee" and "Update Employee" forms has multiple validation issues:
1. It prevents submission when:
   - The field is left empty.
   - The field contains invalid characters (e.g., letters, symbols).
   - The field contains a number exceeding the maximum allowed value (greater than 32).
2. It accepts input with leading zeros (e.g., `00002` or `000032`), which are processed as valid numbers without warnings.
3. It processes partial inputs incorrectly by extracting the first valid number from the string:
   - Examples:
     - `12sdasd` is processed as `12`.
     - `15.23` is processed as `15`.
4. It accepts excessively long numeric input with leading zeros (e.g., `0000000`), which is stored as `0` without validation or warnings.

These issues create a confusing user experience and may result in inconsistent or unexpected data being stored.

## Steps to Reproduce:
### Issue 1: Empty Field
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
3. Leave the "Dependents" field empty.
4. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
5. Attempt to click the "Add" button.
6. Observe that the "Add" button is unclickable.

### Issue 2: Invalid Characters
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter invalid characters (e.g., `abc`, `!@#`, or `2a`) in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Attempt to click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that the "Add" button is unclickable.

### Issue 3: Value Exceeds Maximum Limit
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter a number greater than 32 (e.g., `33` or `32767`) in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Attempt to click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that the "Add" button does not work.

### Issue 4: Leading Zeros
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter valid numbers with leading zeros (e.g., `00002` or `000032`) in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that:
   - The account is created.
   - The leading zeros are ignored, and the value is processed as `2` or `32` without any warnings.

### Issue 5: Partial Inputs
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter mixed input such as `12sdasd` or `15.23` in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that:
   - The account is created.
   - The field processes only the first valid number (`12` or `15`), ignoring the rest of the input without validation or warnings.

### Issue 6: Excessive Leading Zeros
1. Repeat steps 1-2.
2. Enter excessively long values with leading zeros (e.g., `0000000`) in the "Dependents" field.
3. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
4. Click the "Add" button.
5. Observe that:
   - The account is created.
   - The "Dependents" value is stored as `0` without validation or warnings.

## Expected Result:
1. The "Dependents" field should:
   - Reject empty or invalid input with a clear warning message.
   - Display a warning for excessive values (e.g., greater than 32).
   - Reject input with leading zeros and display a message such as:  
     **"Dependents must be a valid positive integer without leading zeros."**
   - Reject mixed input (e.g., `12sdasd`, `15.23`) with a message such as:  
     **"Dependents must be a whole number between 0 and 32."**
   - Reject excessively long inputs with leading zeros (e.g., `0000000`) with a message:  
     **"Dependents value is invalid."**
2. The "Add" or "Update" button should remain functional when valid input is provided.

---

## Actual Result:
1. The "Add" or "Update" button becomes unclickable for:
   - Empty fields.
   - Invalid characters.
   - Values greater than 32.
2. The "Dependents" field accepts:
   - Input with leading zeros (e.g., `00002`, `000032`) and processes them as valid numbers without warnings.
   - Mixed input (e.g., `12sdasd`, `15.23`) and processes only the first valid number without validation or warnings.
3. Excessively long inputs with leading zeros (e.g., `0000000`) are stored as `0` without validation.
