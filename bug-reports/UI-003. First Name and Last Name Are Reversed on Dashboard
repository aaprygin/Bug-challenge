## Bug ID:
UI-003

## Title:
First Name and Last Name Are Reversed on Dashboard After Adding a New Employee

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
On the main dashboard, the employee table displays the first name and last name reversed for all employees. Additionally, when a new employee is added using the "Add Employee" form, their first name and last name are swapped in the table, even though the input in the form was correct.

---

## Steps to Reproduce:
### Issue 1: Names Reversed in Existing Employee Table
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Observe the employee table on the main dashboard.
3. Note that the first name and last name are reversed for all employees.

### Issue 2: Names Reversed After Adding a New Employee
1. Log in to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard as an employer.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button.
3. Enter valid data in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields (e.g., First Name: "Tony", Last Name: "Stark").
4. Click "Save" to add the employee.
5. Observe the employee table, where the first name and last name are swapped (e.g., Last Name: "Tony", First Name: "Stark").

---

## Expected Result:
1. The employee table should display names correctly, with the first name in the "First Name" column and the last name in the "Last Name" column.
2. After adding a new employee, their name should display in the correct columns as entered in the form.

---

## Actual Result:
1. The employee table displays all names with the first name in the "Last Name" column and the last name in the "First Name" column.
2. After adding a new employee, their first name and last name are swapped in the table, despite being entered correctly in the form.
