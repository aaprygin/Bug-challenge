# Feature Request: Simplify and Improve Readability of Employee IDs

---

## Request ID:
FR-003

---

## Title:
Simplify and Improve Readability of Employee IDs

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
Employee IDs are currently displayed as GUIDs (e.g., `3f4ddbe6-2961-47da-adca-1e752dab2c0a`), which are long and difficult to read or remember. While GUIDs are effective for ensuring uniqueness, they are not user-friendly for daily tasks such as searching, sorting, or identifying employees in a table. A simplified and readable format would greatly improve usability.

---

## Current Behavior:
- Employee IDs are displayed as long GUIDs (e.g., `3f4ddbe6-2961-47da-adca-1e752dab2c0a`).
- The format is difficult to read, interpret, or use effectively in a user interface.

---

## Expected Behavior:
Employee IDs should be simplified or presented in a more user-friendly way. Possible solutions include:
1. **Shortened Display Format:**  
   Display only the first and last segments of the GUID (e.g., `3f4ddbe6-...-1e752dab2c0a`).

2. **Custom ID Generation:**  
   Replace GUIDs with shorter, user-friendly IDs (e.g., `EMP-12345` or `HR-56789`).

3. **Contextual Display:**  
   Use GUIDs internally but display readable aliases or labels to the user (e.g., "John Smith - HR123").

---

## Benefits:
1. **Improved Usability:**  
   Users can quickly identify and remember employee IDs without dealing with long GUIDs.
   
2. **Better Presentation:**  
   A simplified format improves the professional appearance of the application.

3. **No Loss of Functionality:**  
   GUIDs can still be used in the backend for data integrity, while the frontend displays user-friendly identifiers.

---

## Severity:
- **Enhancement** (Improves usability but does not block functionality).

---

## Environment:
- **OS**: macOS 15.1 (24B83)  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265 (Official Build) (arm64)  
- **Device**: MacBook Pro M2 2022  

---

## Additional Details:
- **Current Example:** `3f4ddbe6-2961-47da-adca-1e752dab2c0a`
- **Impact:** Simplifying or reformatting employee IDs can significantly improve the user experience, especially in scenarios involving large datasets.
