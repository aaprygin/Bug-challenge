# Feature Request: Improve Clarity of Table Headers to Indicate Data Period

## Request ID:
FR-004

## Title:
Clarify Table Headers to Indicate Data Period (Annual vs. Biweekly)

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
The current table headers (`Salary`, `Gross Pay`, `Benefits Cost`, `Net Pay`) do not clearly indicate the period the data represents. For example:
- **"Salary"** represents the annual amount.
- **"Gross Pay"**, **"Benefits Cost"**, and **"Net Pay"** are biweekly amounts.  
This lack of clarity can confuse users, especially those new to the system, as they may not immediately understand the timeframe these values apply to.

Adding explicit terms like "Annual" or "Biweekly" to the headers would improve user understanding and reduce potential misinterpretation.

---

## Current Behavior:
- Headers such as "Salary", "Gross Pay", "Benefits Cost", and "Net Pay" do not indicate whether the amounts are annual or biweekly.
- Users must rely on context or prior knowledge to interpret the data correctly.

---

## Expected Behavior:
The table headers should clearly indicate the period for each data type. Suggested improvements:
1. Update headers for clarity:
   - **"Salary"** → **"Annual Salary"**
   - **"Gross Pay"** → **"Biweekly Gross Pay"**
   - **"Benefits Cost"** → **"Biweekly Benefits Cost"**
   - **"Net Pay"** → **"Biweekly Net Pay"**

2. Optionally, add tooltips or inline help icons for further explanation:
   - Example tooltip for "Annual Salary":  
     **"The total salary paid annually before deductions."**

---

## Benefits:
1. **Improved Usability:**  
   Users can immediately understand the timeframe of the data without additional explanations.
   
2. **Reduced Confusion:**  
   Clear headers eliminate ambiguity, especially for new users.

3. **Professional Appearance:**  
   Well-labeled headers improve the application's overall quality and professionalism.

---

## Severity:
- **Enhancement** (Improves usability but does not block functionality).

---

## Environment:
- **OS**: macOS 15.1 (24B83)  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265 (Official Build) (arm64)  
- **Device**: MacBook Pro M2 2022  

---

## Additional Details:
- **Current Headers Example:**
   - `Salary`, `Gross Pay`, `Benefits Cost`, `Net Pay`
- **Suggested Headers Example:**
   - `Annual Salary`, `Biweekly Gross Pay`, `Biweekly Benefits Cost`, `Biweekly Net Pay`
- **Impact:**  
   Adding clarity to headers makes the system more intuitive and reduces the need for external clarification.
