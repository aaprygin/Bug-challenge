# Feature Request: Make "Add Employee" and "Log Out" Buttons Always Visible

---

## Request ID:
FR-002

---

## Title:
Keep "Add Employee" and "Log Out" Buttons Always Visible for Better Usability

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
As the number of employee records increases, the "Add Employee" and "Log Out" buttons become less accessible. The "Add Employee" button moves to the bottom of the table, while the "Log Out" button remains fixed at the top of the page. Users are required to scroll extensively to access these buttons, which becomes inconvenient with large datasets. Implementing a floating or fixed-position design for these buttons would greatly improve usability and accessibility.

---

## Current Behavior:
1. **Add Employee Button:**
   - Positioned at the bottom of the table.
   - Users must scroll to the bottom of the page to access it.
   
2. **Log Out Button:**
   - Fixed at the top of the page.
   - Users must scroll back to the top to log out.

---

## Expected Behavior:
1. **Add Employee Button:**
   - The "Add Employee" button should remain visible regardless of the number of records in the table.
   - Possible solutions:
     - Implement a floating button that stays in a fixed position (e.g., bottom-right corner).
     - Move the "Add Employee" button to a fixed toolbar at the top of the page.

2. **Log Out Button:**
   - The "Log Out" button should also remain visible while scrolling.
   - Possible solutions:
     - Include the "Log Out" button in a floating or sticky header that remains fixed at the top of the page.

---

## Benefits:
1. **Improved Usability:**  
   Users can quickly access the "Add Employee" and "Log Out" buttons without unnecessary scrolling.
   
2. **Enhanced Efficiency:**  
   Reduces the time and effort required to perform frequent actions like adding employees or logging out.

3. **Consistent Design:**  
   A floating or sticky design aligns with modern UI/UX standards.

## Severity:
- **Enhancement** (Improves usability but does not block functionality).
