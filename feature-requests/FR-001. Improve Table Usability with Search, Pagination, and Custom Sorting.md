# Feature Request: Improve Table Usability with Search, Pagination, and Custom Sorting

---

## Request ID:
FR-001

---

## Title:
Add Search, Pagination, and Custom Sorting to Employee Table

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
The employee table currently lacks basic usability features such as search, pagination, and customizable sorting. As the number of employees grows, navigating and finding specific records becomes increasingly cumbersome. These features are standard in most data table implementations and are critical for improving user experience and efficiency.

---

## Current Behavior:
1. **No Search or Filters:**  
   Users cannot search for specific employees by name, ID, or other attributes. All records must be manually scrolled through to find specific entries.
   
2. **No Pagination:**  
   All employee records are displayed on a single page. This makes the table difficult to navigate and increases loading times as the number of records grows.
   
3. **Automatic Sorting by ID Only:**  
   The table is automatically sorted by the employee ID column, and users cannot sort by other fields (e.g., Last Name, First Name).

---

## Expected Behavior:
1. **Search Functionality:**  
   Users should be able to search or filter records based on attributes like Last Name, First Name, ID, or other fields.

2. **Pagination:**  
   The table should support pagination to divide records into manageable chunks. For example:
   - Display 10, 20, or 50 records per page.
   - Provide navigation controls (e.g., "Next," "Previous").

3. **Customizable Sorting:**  
   Users should be able to sort the table by any column (e.g., name, role, salary) by clicking on the column header.

---

## Benefits:
1. **Improved Usability:**  
   Users will spend less time scrolling through the table and can find specific employees quickly and efficiently.

2. **Better Performance:**  
   Pagination reduces the load on the browser and the server, especially with a large number of records.

3. **Enhanced User Control:**  
   Sorting by various fields allows users to customize the table view based on their needs.
