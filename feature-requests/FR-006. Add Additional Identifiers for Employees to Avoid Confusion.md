# Feature Request: Add Additional Identifiers for Employees to Avoid Confusion

## Request ID:
FR-006

## Title:
Add Additional Identifiers to Distinguish Employees with Identical Names and Dependents Count

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
The current system allows adding multiple employees with identical names, last names, and dependents count. While this is technically valid (e.g., two employees with the same name), it creates confusion in the table, as there are no additional visible data points to differentiate between them except for the unique ID. This can lead to difficulty when searching, updating, or managing employee records.

Adding additional identifiers, such as job title, department, or email, would help distinguish employees in the table and improve usability.

---

## Current Behavior:
- Employees with the same name, last name, and dependents count are allowed to be added.
- In the table, these records appear identical, except for their internal unique ID, which is not easily visible or user-friendly for identification.

---

## Expected Behavior:
The application should provide additional information in the table to help distinguish employees with identical names. Suggested enhancements include:
1. Adding optional fields in the "Add Employee" and "Update Employee" forms, such as:
   - Email address
   - Job title
   - Department
2. Displaying these fields in the employee table alongside existing columns to provide more context.

---

## Benefits:
1. **Improved Usability:**  
   Users can easily identify and manage employees, even if names and other basic attributes are identical.

2. **Enhanced Professionalism:**  
   Providing additional identifiers aligns the system with real-world HR requirements and improves user trust.

3. **Reduced Errors:**  
   Minimizes the risk of updating or deleting the wrong employee record due to lack of distinguishing information.

---

## Severity:
- **Enhancement** (Improves usability and reduces confusion without blocking functionality).

---

## Environment:
- **OS**: macOS 15.1 (24B83)  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265 (Official Build) (arm64)  
- **Device**: MacBook Pro M2 2022  

---

## Additional Details:
- **Current Table Columns:**
  - `Last Name`, `First Name`, `Dependents`, `Salary`, `Gross Pay`, `Benefits Cost`, `Net Pay`
- **Suggested Table Columns:**
  - Add `Email` and `Job Title` or other relevant fields for better differentiation.
- **Impact:**  
   This feature is particularly beneficial for organizations with a large number of employees, where identical names are more likely to occur.
