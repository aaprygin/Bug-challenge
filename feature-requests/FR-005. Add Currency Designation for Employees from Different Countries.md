# Feature Request: Add Currency Designation for Employees from Different Countries

---

## Request ID:
FR-005

---

## Title:
Allow Currency Designation for Employees from Different Countries

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
Currently, the application assumes a single currency for all employees, which may not reflect real-world scenarios where employees are located in different countries. Adding a currency designation field in the "Add Employee" and "Update Employee" forms, as well as displaying the corresponding currency symbol in the employee table, would provide better support for global operations.

---

## Current Behavior:
- The application does not allow specifying the currency for employee salaries.
- The employee table and forms do not display any currency symbol, leading to ambiguity when managing employees across multiple regions.

---

## Expected Behavior:
1. **In the "Add Employee" and "Update Employee" Forms:**
   - Add a dropdown menu or input field to select the employee's currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP).

2. **In the Employee Table:**
   - Display the corresponding currency symbol (e.g., `$`, `€`, `£`) for salary-related fields such as "Gross Pay", "Benefits Cost", and "Net Pay".

3. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Allow currency conversion based on the selected currency for better cross-border reporting.

---

## Benefits:
1. **Global Usability:**  
   Supports businesses with employees in multiple countries by ensuring accurate financial representation.

2. **Reduced Ambiguity:**  
   Clarifies the monetary values in the application by associating them with specific currencies.

3. **Enhanced Professionalism:**  
   Adds flexibility and professionalism to the application, making it more suitable for international use.

---

## Severity:
- **Enhancement** (Adds valuable functionality without blocking current operations).

---

## Environment:
- **OS**: macOS 15.1 (24B83)  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265 (Official Build) (arm64)  
- **Device**: MacBook Pro M2 2022  

---

## Additional Details:
- **Forms Affected:**
  - "Add Employee" Form
  - "Update Employee" Form
- **Table Fields Affected:**
  - `Gross Pay`
  - `Benefits Cost`
  - `Net Pay`
- **Impact:**  
   This feature is particularly beneficial for organizations operating in multiple regions or managing remote employees globally.
