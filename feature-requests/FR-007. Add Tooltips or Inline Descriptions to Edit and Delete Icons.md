## Request ID:
FR-007

## Title:
Add Tooltips or Inline Descriptions to Edit and Delete Icons for Better Usability

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
Currently, the "Edit" and "Delete" icons in the employee table do not have any accompanying text or descriptions, which may confuse new users or those unfamiliar with standard iconography. Adding tooltips (hover text) or inline labels would clarify the purpose of these buttons, improving the user experience.

---

## Current Behavior:
- The "Edit" and "Delete" actions are represented solely by icons.
- Users must rely on their familiarity with these icons to understand their functionality.
- No tooltips or inline descriptions are provided for additional guidance.

---

## Expected Behavior:
1. **Tooltips:**  
   - When users hover over the "Edit" or "Delete" icons, a tooltip should appear with text such as:
     - **Edit:** "Edit employee details."
     - **Delete:** "Remove this employee."
2. **Inline Labels (Optional):**  
   - Add a short text label next to each icon (e.g., "Edit" and "Delete") for persistent visibility.

---

## Benefits:
1. **Improved Usability:**  
   Ensures that all users, including those unfamiliar with the icons, understand the functionality without guessing.

2. **Accessibility Enhancement:**  
   Supports assistive technologies by providing additional context for screen readers.

3. **Professional Design:**  
   Adds clarity and a more polished look to the user interface.

---

## Severity:
- **Enhancement** (Improves usability but does not block functionality).

---

## Environment:
- **OS**: macOS 15.1 (24B83)  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265 (Official Build) (arm64)  
- **Device**: MacBook Pro M2 2022  

---

## Additional Details:
- **Current Icons:**  
   - Pencil icon for "Edit."
   - Trash can icon for "Delete."
- **Suggested Tooltips:**  
   - Edit: "Edit employee details."
   - Delete: "Remove this employee."
- **Impact:**  
   Clear descriptions reduce confusion and make the interface more user-friendly, especially for new users.
