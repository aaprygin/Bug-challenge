## Observation ID:
OBS-002

## Title:
High Values in Dependents Field Cause Server Errors (400 and 405)

---

## Application:
Paylocity Benefits Dashboard

---

## Description:
When entering extremely high values (e.g., 32767 or 32768) in the "Dependents" field of the "Add Employee" form, the server returns inconsistent errors:
- For `32767`, the server responds with a **400 Bad Request** error.
- For `32768`, the server responds with a **405 Method Not Allowed** error.
These errors indicate that the server struggles to handle or validate such large inputs properly. There is no clear feedback to the user about the issue.

---

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard.
2. Enable developer tools by pressing `F12`.
3. Switch to the "Console" tab.
4. Click the "Add Employee" button to open the form.
5. In the "Dependents" field, enter `32767`.
6. Fill in all other fields with valid data.
7. Click the "Add" button.
8. Observe the **400 Bad Request** error in the developer console.

9. Repeat steps 1-7, but enter `32768` in the "Dependents" field.
10. Observe the **405 Method Not Allowed** error in the developer console.

---

## Expected Result:
- The server should handle large values gracefully and return a clear error message (e.g., "The number of dependents must not exceed 32767").
- The client-side form should validate inputs and prevent submission of invalid values.

---

## Actual Result:
1. **For 32767:** The server returns a **400 Bad Request** error with no explanation for the user.
2. **For 32768:** The server returns a **405 Method Not Allowed** error, which is unexpected for this scenario.

## Severity:
- **Low** (Requires further investigation to determine the actual impact on functionality and security).

## Environment:
- **OS**: macOS 15.1 (24B83)  
- **Browser**: Google Chrome Version 131.0.6778.265 (Official Build) (arm64)
